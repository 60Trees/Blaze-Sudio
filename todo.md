# AIs TODO:

 - https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free
 - [ ] GPT4ALL
 - [ ] Auto-GPT
 - [ ] LLAMA

### I'm now considering whether or not to do these...
 - [ ] any others in LOLLM... what ones?

# Image AIs TODO:
 - [ ] Google Bard Image AI (I think maybe possible? Needs research.)
 - [ ] Sydney (Bing AI) Image AI (I think maybe possible? Needs research.)
 - [ ] any old diffusion image generator
 - [ ] GPT4Art (from gpt4all)

# Things TODO:
 - [x] A UI for downloading GPT4All models for offline
 - [ ] The EVERY AI, which includes:
>  - [ ] Multi-AI support
>  - [ ] Switching AI support
 - [x] the base AI to be real good and customisable
 - [x] characters
 - [x] conversations
 - [ ] game engine (in main.py)
 - [ ] UI
 - [x] A GOOD name for all this
 - [ ] STT (speech to text)
 - [ ] Sound generator which includes:
>  - [ ] Seeded MIDI generator
>  - [ ] AI music generator
>  - [ ] Get music from Zelda
>  Please note that each game SHOULD only have one type of these above musics in them or it will sound odd. Possibly AI+Zelda if it cannot find the right music, but it shouldn't need to come to that. Acutally, maybe if it comes to that import more Zelda music. BOTW and TOTK.
